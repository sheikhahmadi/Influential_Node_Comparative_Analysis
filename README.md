# Influential_Node_Comparative_Analysis
This repository provides a comprehensive collection of datasets and implementations for the comparative analysis of influential node detection methods in complex networks. It serves as a benchmarking platform for researchers and practitioners interested in evaluating and improving influence detection techniques.

## What’s Included?
- Datasets: A curated set of real-world and synthetic network datasets used in influence detection studies.
- Baseline Methods: Implementations of classical centrality-based (Degree, Betweenness, Closeness, PageRank, K-Shell) and learning-based (GNN, GCN, GAT, Node2Vec) approaches.
- Evaluation Metrics: Standard metrics such as SIR-based influence spread, Kendall’s Tau, NDCG, and RMSE for performance comparison.
- Experimental Results: Comparative analysis and performance reports on different datasets.

## Why This Repository?
- Standardized Benchmark – Provides a common ground for evaluating different influence detection methods.
- Reproducibility – Offers well-documented code and datasets to ensure replicable experiments.
- Extensibility – Encourages contributions and modifications to explore new influence detection techniques.
